A good automation framework should be:
1. Modular
The more modular the framework, the easier maintenance will be. When code is shared between multiple testcases and there is a change to the system under test, the automater would just need to make their changes in one place and all the scripts will be up to date.
It should have a Function Libraries to contain all functions used in the framework.
It should have a Page object repository for all pages.
 
2. Flexible
Having parameters in your framework gives more control to the user to determine which scenarios they would like to run. This is useful if they identify a potential bug in the system that might have been overlooked. This diminishes the pesticide paradox to a certain degree.
 
3. Easy to understand
A framework that is easy to understand, intuitive and has comments assists in making maintenance easier.
 
4. Reliable
The results of the testcases should be reliable i.e. there should be no doubt that a passed testcase is a false positive.
